# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking their respective symbols (X or O) on the board, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

# Features
1. Player vs. Player mode: Two human players can play against each other.
2. Randomized turn order: The game randomly selects which player goes first.
3. Interactive gameplay: Players can input their moves using the keyboard.
4. Win and draw detection: The game checks for win conditions and declares the winner or a draw.
5. Replay option: After a game ends, players can choose to play again.

# How to Play
1. Run the tic-tac-toe.py file using Python.
2. Enter the preferred mark for each player (X or O).
3. The game will randomly select which player goes first.
4. Enter "Yes" to start the game or "No" to exit.
5. Players take turns entering their desired position (1-9) to place their mark.
6. The game will display the updated board after each move.
7. The game will determine the winner or declare a draw.
8. Players can choose to play again by entering "Yes" or exit by entering "No".
