# tic-tac-toe
This project contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking their respective symbols (X or O) on the board, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
